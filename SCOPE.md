# Scope of Experiments

This file provides illustrative examples of experimental paradigms, tasks, effects, and measurements that are typically relevant for inclusion in PsychLing-101.  
These examples are not exhaustive: each dataset contribution will be evaluated individually to ensure it aligns with the project’s goals and data requirements.

## 1. Ambiguity Resolution Studies

### 1.1 Syntactic Ambiguity
**Effects**  
- Garden-path effects: *Put the frog on the napkin into the box*  
- Dependency resolution: anaphoric relations, agreement relations  
- Subject–object ambiguity  

**Tasks**  
- Self-paced reading  
- Visual World Paradigm (+ audio)  #todiscuss - we do not want the audio data

**Measurements**  
- Self-paced reading times  
- Eye-tracking: fixation durations, regressions, reading times at critical regions  
- ERP components: P600 (syntactic reanalysis), ELAN (early syntactic structure building)  
- Accuracy judgments  

### 1.2 Lexical/Semantic Ambiguity
- Example: *bank* (financial vs. river bank)  


## 2. Incremental Sentence Processing

### 2.1 Semantic Processing
**Effects**  
- Semantic integration  
- Semantic/world knowledge violations  
- Semantic priming  

**Measurements**  
- Reaction times (RT)  
- ERP: N400 (semantic incongruency effects)  

### 3.2 Morphosyntactic Processing
**Effects**  
- Subject–verb agreement  
- Gender/number agreement  
- Inflectional processing  

**Measurements**  
- ERP: LAN (early morphosyntactic violations)  
- Grammaticality judgments  
- RT  

### 2.3 Predictive Processing
**Effects**  
- Lexical predictability  
- Pre-activation of upcoming words  
- Expectation violations  

**Tasks**  
- Cloze tasks  
- Self-paced reading  
- Visual World Paradigm  
- Eye-tracking during reading  
- EEG  

**Measurements**  
- Cloze probability  
- Reading times  
- First fixation duration  
- ERP  


## 3. Priming Studies
- Semantic / lexical priming  
- Syntactic priming  


## 4. Contextual Influences on Processing
**Effects**  
- Visual context: action depictions, speaker's gaze, emotional expressions  
- Linguistic context: register effects, factual knowledge, lifetime knowledge  
- Processing of morphosyntactic distinctions: *he confirms* vs. *he confirm*  
- Processing of semantic distinctions: *tying your shoelaces* vs. *folding your shoelaces*  

**Measurements**  
- RT  
- Accuracy  
- Eye-tracking  


## 5. Prosody and Intonation Studies - #todiscus can we work with it without the audio files?


## 6. Discourse Processing Studies
**Measurements**  
- Recall accuracy  
- Response times  
- Eye-tracking

## 7. Lexico-Semantic Judgments :
* Similarity/relatedness judgments
* Word fluency
* Odd-one-out
* Affective & evaluative norms: valence, arousal, dominance
* Conceptual accessibility: concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition 
* Iconicity & transparency: form–meaning mapping ratings 
* Goals/needs: goal-directedness/need-related ratings 
* Feature & associability: number of features; meaningfulness/associability
* Semantic decisions: category/property/semantic decision

## 8. Association Paradigms

## 9. Lexical Processing Tasks
* Lexical decision task 
* Naming task
